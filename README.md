# reddit-project-vue

## Deployed development version
```
https://development-reddit-frontend.herokuapp.com/
```

## Deployed old main version
```
https://demo-reddit-admir-halilovic.herokuapp.com/
```

The old version contains bootstrap that I removed in the 'new version'. Started learning tailwind and I am now implementing it in the newer version.
Also refactoring code like websockets, ts in components ...
